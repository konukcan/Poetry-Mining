# Poetry-Mining

My project is meant to be in line with the research I want to do for the cogmaster. 

My aim being to make analysis of patterns and emotions on large datasets of poetry in order to distinguish regularities such as differences between authors or evolutions over history. For this I will have to process huge databases of texts that cannot be process without using automated sofwares.

Therefore, my goal is to build a program that'd allow be to do it 
Given it is harder to perform such analysis on the pattern (formal regularities) of poetry, and given I am new to code, I will start by only performing analyses on lexicon and emotions. This is a way for me to play around with the tools provided by computer analysis before having a more sophisticated use of them later on.
