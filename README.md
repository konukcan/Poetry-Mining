# Poetry-Mining

My project is meant to be in line with the research I want to do for the cogmaster. 

My aim being to study French poetry to make historical interpretations of the apparitions of some patterns during the classical 
(XVIth - XVIIth erea). For this I will have to process huge databases of texts that cannot be process without using automated sofwares.

Therefore, my goal is to build one such software that would allow me to extract such patterns from big databases, taking inspirations from already existing instruments doing this type of things.
Since the XVIth XVIIth databases I want to access are hard to get, I will start doing this with smaller and more accessible databases of text to play around with the tool and get more familiar with it for later research use.
